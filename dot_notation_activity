# Activity 2
print("The cat in the hat")

print("The cat in the hat".upper())
# method changes string from lowercase to uppercase

print("The cat in the hat".lower())
# method changes string to lowercase

print("The cat in the hat".capitalize())
# method capitalises the first word of the sentance(String)- string doesn't have concept of grammatical rules

print("The cat in the hat".count("the"))
# method counts how many times the word occurs for example 'the' occurs only once. Need quotations within brackets of word you're trying to find.

print("The cat in the hat".find("in"))
# method tells you WHERE to find the word 'in'- in this case following zero-index in python, the word 'in' is 9 characters in

print("The cat in the hat".replace("hat","bag"))
# method replaces whatever word you would like to replace with another e.g hat to bag

print("The cat in the hat".strip("The"))
# Main purpose get's rid of spaces but only at the start or end of the sting. Can also remove the word that is within the brackets at the end.

print("12345".isnumeric())
# gives a boolean answer. It is either True or False that the code is numeric. The answer is true as within the speech marks is a whole number.

print("hello, my name is Gemma, I am 26 years old".split(","))
# method, seperates each work after commor 

print("#banana#strawberry#cherry#grapes".split("#"))
# method- splits string into list format

print("The cat in the hat".swapcase())
# changes the capitlize letter to lowercase and the lowercase changes to uppercase.

print("All around the world".upper()[7])

print("All Around The World"[7].upper())
# both these do the same thing- 7 characters into the string will be changed to a capatized letter.
